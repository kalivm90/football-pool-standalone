# how to use

currently on Render under the github profile kalivm90 there is a instance of a postres server running with the database. Installed on the desktop is a app called pgAdmin that contains a connection to this instance on render where you can run queries and look at the data. It requires a password to get in (i set it to remember) but if you ever need to use it it's inside the .env file and
im sure you can find it on Render.com if you needed to find it again.
