# Football Pool (standalone)

This is meant to automate the process of finding the winner in a large football pool instead of doing it manually with a sheet of paper. The plan is to expand this is to a full site where users in the group can make their picks through the site and have the results be available right after the last game ends. This is more just a proof of concept before I commit to making the full website and since the season just ended I may wait until closer to next season to do it.

## How to start

```
npm install
npm start
```
